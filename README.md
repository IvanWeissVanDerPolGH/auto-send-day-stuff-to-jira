auto send day stuff to jira


project to automatically log my hours in jira
at a company i worked we could keep track of our time and upload it at the end of the month 
so i wrote some code and automated a solution to a task that took 10 min (slow browser + slow speed of writing and clicking manually ) to something you run at the end of the month while packing up to go home (maybe 1 min )
